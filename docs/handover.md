Create a standalone handover to continue this work in another LLM.

Requirements:

- Summarize the entire conversation so far.
- Include all key decisions, constraints, and assumptions.
- Extract concrete requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have) and non-goals.
- List current status and what’s already done.
- Provide next steps as an ordered checklist.
- Include any relevant snippets (APIs, file paths, commands, pseudocode), but only the minimum necessary.
- Capture style/tone preferences that matter.
- Do not reference “earlier messages” or “above”. Make it fully self-contained.
- Keep it concise but complete, using bullet points and clear headings.
