# Paperweight 🗿

**Your inbox knows where your data lives. We help you take back control.**

Every account you create, every service you sign up for, every online purchase is connected to your email address. Most people have 100+ accounts they've forgotten about, creating security risks and privacy exposure.

Local-first. Your data stays on your computer. Respecting your privacy by default.
